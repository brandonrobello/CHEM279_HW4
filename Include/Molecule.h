 * @class Molecule
 * 
 * @brief Represents a Molecule object with its vector of Atoms and associated basis functions.
 * 
 * The Molecule class models a molecular system in quantum chemistry, storing information about its
 * atoms, basis functions, and quantum matrices such as the overlap matrix, Hamiltonian matrix, and molecular
 * orbital coefficients. It provides functionality to compute overlaps between Gaussian basis functions,
 * build the Hamiltonian, and calculate the total energy of the molecule.
 * 
 * The class also allows for the construction of atomic and basis function information,
 * with methods to print the overlap and Hamiltonian matrices.
 * 
 * @details
 * - **atoms_**: Vector storing the atoms that make up the molecule.
 * - **basisFunctions_**: Vector of basis functions used to describe molecular orbitals.
 * - **S_overlap_matrix_**: Overlap matrix for the basis functions.
 * - **H_matrix_**: Hamiltonian matrix for the molecule.
 * - **C_matrix_**: Molecular orbital coefficient matrix.
